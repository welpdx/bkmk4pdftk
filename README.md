While pdftk is great at adding bookmarks to a pdf, many (including me) find it's format tedious. This project tries to generate a pdftk format bookrmark file from a table in google sheets. Simply recreate the table of contents in one tab, click the link, and bam, you can download the pdftk file to add onto your pdf.
